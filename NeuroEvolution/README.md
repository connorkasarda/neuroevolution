# NeuroEvolution
This implementation explores and visualizes evolutionary algorithms, like the NEAT system, for neural network generation. The algorithm behind NEAT employs **genetic encoding**, **gene tracking**, **speciation**, and **incremental growth** as methods for training and constructing a neural network.
