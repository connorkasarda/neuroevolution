# Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
This is my implementation of the NEAT algorithm in C/C++. The authors also used C/C++ for their initial implementation. C/C++ was chosen for its low-level nature and speed. Experiments will be presented numerically, not graphically; no GUI will be implemented. Perhaps, project may be migrated to a Processing or GUI framework for visuals in the future.
