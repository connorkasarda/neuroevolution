# Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
This is my implementation of the NEAT algorithm in Julia. The authors used C++ for their initial implementation. Julia was chosen for its low-level nature, speed, and fit for machine learning. Experiments will be presented numerically, not graphically; no GUI will be implemented. Perhaps, project may be migrated to a Processing framework for visuals in the future.
