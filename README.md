# Neurospace
Fun environment for learning about neural networks and how to generate them automatically via artificial evolution

## Directory
These directories separate the Neurospace project into many subprojects
### NN
- The basics of neural networks
- Uses manual toggling and creation of nodes and weights to build neural networks
### NEAT
- Reveals the NEAT algorithm visually
- Utilizes ideas inspired by evolution to construct a neural network from the bottom up
