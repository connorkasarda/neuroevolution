# NeuroSpace
Fun environment for learning about neural networks and how to generate them automatically via artificial evolution

## Directory
These directories separate the Neurospace project into many subprojects
### NeuralNetwork
- The basics of neural networks with an input, a hidden, and an output layer
### DeepLearning
- Explores deep learning neural network implementations: ANNs, RNNs, and CNNs
### NeuroEvolution
- Utilizes ideas inspired by evolution to stochastically construct a neural network from the bottom up
